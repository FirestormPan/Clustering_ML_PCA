# Clustering_ML_PCA
Comparing the clustering process with PCA and without PCA, based on metrics

The project is on the well known fashion-mnist dataset. The use of Principal component analysis(PCA), even though it helps with computation times, it is losing some information. The goal of this project is to train miniBatch K-means, K-means , and agglomerative models, with and without PCA. After the training is complete, I am evaluating the how much worse the results are with the use of PCA and if the results are acceptable, based on silhuette coefficient, Calinski-Harabasz Index, Davis-Bouldin index and homogenity. 

The report included is in Greek.
